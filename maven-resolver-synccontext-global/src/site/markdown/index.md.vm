The Global Sync Context Factory is Java global lock factory for Maven Resolver to provide a
concurrent-safe access from a single Maven instance to the same local Maven repository.

For further details about the factory read the [Javadoc](./apidocs/org/eclipse/aether/synccontext/GlobalSyncContextFactory.html).

${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Open Issues/Notes

- It only works when dependency injection is used and not the bundled `AetherModule` or
  `ServiceLocator` (Maven uses dependency injection).
- Usage from plugins has not been tested yet.
- The `furnace-maven-plugin` does not work this implementation because it uses `ServiceLocator` instead
  of dependency injection.

${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Installation/Testing
- Copy the following dependencies from Maven Central to `${maven.home}/lib/ext/`:
      <pre class="source">
      ├── <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax/annotation/javax.annotation-api/1.3.2/javax.annotation-api-1.3.2.jar">javax.annotation-api-1.3.2.jar</a>
      └── <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/resolver/${project.artifactId}/${project.version}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar">${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar</a></pre>
- Now start a multithreaded Maven build on your project.

${esc.hash}${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Debugging

- Add/modify the following entries in `${maven.conf}/logging/simplelogger.properties`:
      ```
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showDateTime=true
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showThreadName=true
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showShortLogName=true
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.eclipse.aether.synccontext=trace
      ```
- Now start a multithreaded Maven build on your project and you should see at least these lines:
      ```
      4626 [main] [TRACE] GlobalSyncContextFactory$GlobalSyncContext - Acquiring global...
      35318 [main] [TRACE] GlobalSyncContextFactory$GlobalSyncContext - Releasing global...
      ```
